# Webinar 2021
This webinar was about using Pulumi to standing up some K8s infrastructure and then plugging it into the Codefresh dashboard and using Codefresh to monitor the K8s deployments, etc.

On the Pulumi side it showcases Pulumi IaC as well as a dynamic provider used to configure the Codefresh dashboard.
